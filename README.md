# Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books-710px-width

I want to embed [Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books](https://github.com/cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books) 's images into my Notion page, but Notion does not automatically resize images that are less than 710px in width, causing them to be left-aligned instead of filling the content width.

To fix this, I forked the repository and created a script to ensure all images are at least 710px wide, making them display properly in Notion.
